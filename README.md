# Tesseract_formfinding
abstract generative sketch inspired by multidimensional space (p5.js)
# Description
This project is a personal generative sketch created with p5.js (WEBGL).
It explores an abstract, visual interpretation of higher-dimensional space.Rather than a scientific simulation, the sketch focuses on spatial illusion, rotation, layered waves, and continuous motion to evoke the feeling of falling through a curved, multidimensional structure.
# Tools
p5.js
JavaScript (WEBGL)
# Notes
This work is part of a series of experimental generative studies focused on space, motion, and perception.
